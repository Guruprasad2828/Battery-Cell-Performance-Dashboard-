The relationship between state of charge (SoC) and open-circuit voltage (OCV) is crucial for understanding battery performance and management. The SoC indicates the current charge level of a battery relative to its total capacity, typically expressed as a percentage. In contrast, the OCV represents the voltage of a battery when it is not connected to any load or charger, reflecting its electrochemical potential.
Generally its a non linear releation curve by refering several paper , the curve looks to be a 8th order polynomial curve . Here the equation that i took is 3rd order curve just to show genralised effect
